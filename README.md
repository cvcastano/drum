# Keyboard-operated drum set

Exercise resulting from my first code challenge right after finishing the bootcamp at <a href="https://adalab.es"><img alt="Adalab" src="https://adalab.es/wp-content/themes/adalab/assets/legacy/images/logo-adalab.svg" width="70px"/></a>

It's a cool drum set that is operated by pressing the keys on the computer keyboard.
